[UPDATE flashier demo here and slow intro how you can achieve the same] It might take weeks or months for the lottery to finish with that change so not recommended. Idea is though that you can see every single row that is being generated on your screen.] https://youtu.be/4ZqyoQytziQ

Most of the code under folder https://github.com/lpaajarvi/dreamCrusher/tree/main/app/src/main/java/fi/lpaajarvi/dreamcrusher


Lets user pick Lotto Numbers 1-39 by pressing numbers. After pressing the start button, it will simulate Lottery over and over again, until the jackpot all 7 won has been reached. LottoService will broadcast each time a new landmark has been reached (first time 4 correct, 5 correct etc), and update the results in the mobile phone screen.

It will tell you how many years it would have taken for you to win the jackpot, if you played with those numbers every week of the year.
