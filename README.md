Lets user pick Lotto Numbers 1-39 by pressing numbers. After pressing the start button, it will simulate Lottery over and over again, until the jackpot all 7 won has been reached. LottoService will broadcast each time a new landmark has been reached (first time 4 correct, 5 correct etc), and update the results in the mobile phone screen.

It will tell you how many years it would have taken for you to win the jackpot, if you played with those numbers every week of the year.
